## Payment infrastructure

### PI-SPI

lomi. integrates with the **SPI**, the official Central Bank-backed payment interoperability platform. With lomi., you can accept payments across 8 UEMOA countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo). Our platform enables Bank-to-Bank, Bank-to-Wallet, Wallet-to-Bank, and Wallet-to-Wallet transactions through our suite of APIs.

The platform provides instant payment confirmation and settlement, allowing you to send payments using SHID, MCOD, or MBNO aliases without ever sharing account numbers. We offer native support for the West African CFA Franc (XOF).

For fellow fintechs, we built an SDK around this infrastructure: `@lomi/pi-spi-sdk` - a community TypeScript SDK for the PI-SPI Business API ([apps/pi-spi-sdk](./apps/pi-spi-sdk)).

### Additional Payment providers

For regions outside UEMOA or specific use cases, lomi. is built on top of Stripe for enabling international card payments and cryptocurrency payments.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **pnpm** or **bun** package manager
- **PostgreSQL** >= 15 (for local development)
- **Supabase CLI** (optional, for local Supabase instance)
- **PI-SPI API credentials** (for UEMOA payment processing)
- **Stripe Connect** for international credit card payment processing

### Database setup

lomi. uses **separate database configurations** for local development and production:

- **Local development**: Uses local PostgreSQL instance via Supabase CLI
- **Production**: Uses Supabase cloud instance with enhanced security and scalability

This separation ensures safe testing without affecting production data, independent schema evolution, and environment-specific optimizations.

### Local development (via merchant dashboard)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lomiafrica/lomi./
cd lomi.

# Set up environment variables
cp apps/dashboard/.env.example apps/dashboard/.env
cd apps/dashboard

# Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```
