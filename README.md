## About lomi.

lomi. is an open-source payment processing platform that integrates multiple payment service providers and provides a seamless experience for merchants and their customers across West Africa and beyond. Our platform simplifies product, services, usage, and subscription billing while ensuring the highest levels of security, reliability, and compliance.

## Open-source roadmap

We are progressively open-sourcing the entire project:

- **Currently open-source**:
  - Documentation: **[apps/docs](./apps/docs)**
  - CLI: **[apps/cli](./apps/cli)**
  - APIs: **[apps/api](./apps/api)**
  - SDK: **[apps/sdk](./apps/sdk)**
  - Boilerplate (Next.js x Sanity): **[apps/events](https://github.com/lomiafrica/events/)**

- **Opening soon**:
  - Merchant dashboard: **[apps/website](./apps/website)**
  - Admin dashboard: **[apps/admin](./apps/website)**
  - Shopify extension: **[apps/shopify](./apps/shopify)**

Everything will be made available in the coming months and all separate repositories will be merged in the monorepo.

## Payment infrastructure

lomi. integrates with the **SPI**, the official Central Bank-backed payment interoperability platform. With lomi., you can accept payments across 8 UEMOA countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo). Our platform enables Bank-to-Bank, Bank-to-Wallet, Wallet-to-Bank, and Wallet-to-Wallet transactions through our suite of APIs.

The platform provides instant payment confirmation and settlement, allowing you to send payments using SHID, MCOD, or MBNO aliases without ever sharing account numbers. We offer native support for the West African CFA Franc (XOF).

For fellow fintechs, we built an SDK around this infrastructure: `@lomi/pi-spi-sdk` - a community TypeScript SDK for the PI-SPI Business API ([apps/pi-spi-sdk](./apps/pi-spi-sdk)).

For merchants operating outside UEMOA, lomi. is built on Stripe to enable international payments, including cards and cryptocurrencies.
