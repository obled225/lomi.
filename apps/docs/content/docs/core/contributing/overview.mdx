# Getting started

Ready to make your first contribution to lomi.? This guide will walk you through finding an issue, setting up your development environment, making changes, and submitting them.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: For version control.
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: We recommend the latest LTS version.
- **[bun](https://bun.sh/)**: Our preferred package manager for managing dependencies in the monorepo.

<Steps>

### Find an issue to work on

Before diving into code, it's helpful to find an existing issue or propose a new one:

- Browse [open issues](https://github.com/lomiafrica/lomi./issues) on the main repository.
- Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` if you're new.
- If you have a new idea or bug fix, consider creating a new issue to discuss it first.
- Don't hesitate to ask questions in the issue comments if anything is unclear.

### Fork the repository

Start by forking the main lomi. repository on GitHub:

1. Go to the [lomi. repository](https://github.com/lomiafrica/lomi.).
2. Give us a star !
3. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner.

### Clone your fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/beloved_anon/lomi.git
cd lomi.
```

Replace `<beloved_anon>` with your real GitHub username.

### Set upstream remote

Add the original lomi. repository as the `upstream` remote. This allows you to keep your fork synchronized with the main project.

```bash filename="Terminal"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lomiafrica/lomi./
```

Verify the remotes:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git remote -v
# origin  https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/lomi./ (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/lomi./ (push)
# upstream https://github.com/lomiafrica/lomi./ (fetch)
# upstream https://github.com/lomiafrica/lomi./ (push)
```

### Install dependencies & set up environment

Install the project dependencies using `bun` from the root of the monorepo:

```bash filename="Terminal"
bun install
```

Set up your local environment variables by copying the example file:

```bash filename="Terminal"
cp .env.example .env
# Review the .env file and add any necessary secrets or configurations
```

### Local development commands

Here are some common commands you'll use during development:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Start the main development server (specific app may vary)
# Check the package.json in the specific app/package directory
bun run dev

# Build and serve the documentation site locally
bun run docs:dev

# Run linting checks across the project
bun run lint

# Run linters and automatically fix issues
bun run lint:fix
```

### Create a branch

Before making changes, create a new branch based on the `develop` branch. Follow our [Branching strategy](/docs/core/contributing/branching-strategy) for naming conventions.

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Fetch the latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Check out the develop branch
git checkout develop

# Pull the latest changes for develop
git pull upstream develop

# Create your feature or bugfix branch
git checkout -b <BRANCH_TYPE>/<SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
# Example: git checkout -b feature/add-cool-new-thing
# Example: git checkout -b fix/resolve-that-bug
```

### Make your changes

Now you can start making your code or documentation changes within the appropriate package or app in the `packages/` or `apps/` directory.

- **Code changes**: Write your code, ensuring it adheres to our [Code standards](/docs/core/contributing/best-practices#code-standards) and [Best practices](/docs/core/contributing/best-practices).
- **Documentation changes**: Update or add documentation in the relevant `apps/developers/src/pages/docs/` directory. Use Markdown (`.mdx`).

**Keep your branch updated:**

Periodically, keep your branch up-to-date with the latest changes from the upstream `develop` branch:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Fetch the latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your branch onto the latest develop branch
# Make sure you have committed or stashed your local changes first!
git rebase upstream/develop

# You might need to resolve conflicts during the rebase process.
# After resolving conflicts: git add . ; git rebase --continue
# If you get stuck: git rebase --abort
```

### Test your changes

Ensure your changes pass all relevant tests and meet our quality standards.

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Example: Running tests for a specific package
# Replace <package_name> with the actual package, e.g., @lomi/api
bun --filter <package_name> test

# Run specific tests using a pattern (e.g., tests related to 'payment')
bun test -- --grep "payment"

# Run all tests across the monorepo
bun test

# Run tests and generate a coverage report
bun run test:coverage
```

Write tests for your changes. See the [Code standards](/docs/core/contributing/best-practices#code-standards) section for an example.

### Commit your changes

Commit your changes using a descriptive message that follows our [Commit message guidelines](/docs/core/contributing/branching-strategy#commit-messages). Adhering to the format helps automate releases and changelogs.

**Commit message format:**

```text filename="Commit Message Format"
<type>(<scope>): <description>

# Examples:
# feat(api): add support for webhook signature verification
# fix(docs): correct typo in getting started guide
# chore(deps): update dependency xyz
```

**Example commit:**

```bash filename="Terminal"
git add .
git commit -m "feat(payments): implement new payment provider"
```

See [Best practices](/docs/core/contributing/best-practices#best-practices) for good vs. bad commit message examples.

### Push your changes

Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git push origin <BRANCH_NAME>
```

### Submit a pull request (PR)

1.  Go to your fork on GitHub (`https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/lomi.`).
2.  You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your recently pushed branch. Click "**Compare & pull request**".
3.  Ensure the base repository is `lomiafrica/lomi.` and the base branch is `develop`.
4.  The head repository should be your fork, and the compare branch should be your feature/fix branch.
5.  **Write a clear PR title:** Use the same format as commit messages (`<type>(<scope>): <description>`).
6.  **Fill out the PR template:** Provide a clear description of your changes, including:
    *   **Changes:** What did you change and why?
    *   [ ] My code follows the style guidelines of this project.
    *   [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code.
    *   [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.
    *   [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation.
    *   [ ] My changes generate no new warnings.
    *   [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.
    *   [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes (`bun test`).
    *   [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged and published in downstream modules.
    *   [ ] Commits are squashed appropriately (if needed) and have meaningful messages.
8.  Submit the Pull Request.
