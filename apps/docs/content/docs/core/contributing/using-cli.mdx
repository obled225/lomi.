## Initializing a Git repository

To get started, initialize a Git repository in the directory where your integration code and configuration files are stored:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git init
```

## Staging and committing changes

After making changes to your integration code or configurations, stage the changes using the `git add` command:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git add .
```

Then, commit the changes with a descriptive message:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git commit -m "Update payment provider configuration"
```

## Pushing changes to a remote repository

To collaborate with your team, push your changes to a remote repository:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git push origin develop
```

Replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if you're using a different branching strategy.

## Pulling changes from a remote repository

To get the latest changes made by your team members, pull the changes from the remote repository:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git pull origin develop
```

Again, replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if necessary.

## Resolving merge conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts when pulling changes, you'll need to resolve them manually. Open the conflicting files, make the necessary changes, and then stage and commit the resolved files:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git add resolved_file.js
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

## Best practices

- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Use branches for developing new features or configurations
- Regularly pull changes from the remote repository to stay up-to-date
- Resolve merge conflicts carefully and communicate with your team

By using the Git CLI effectively and following best practices, you can collaborate smoothly with your team on your lomi. integration.
