## Refunds

You can issue both **full and partial refunds** to your customers. However, initial transaction fees are non-refundable, as payment providers charge them regardless of any future refund. Additionally, a refund processing fee of 4% applies to all refunded transactions. In the case of a full refund, your customer will receive the full amount they paid—without any penalties, as the merchant absorbs the costs.

## Disputes

Sometimes, customers may dispute a transaction or request a chargeback via their payment provider. **Each dispute costs 10,000 XOF, regardless of the outcome**, and is deducted from your balance directly. This fee is charged by the underlying payment providers and **cannot be refunded**.

Chargebacks are rare on mobile money transactions, but we work proactively to **meet global industry standards** and minimize and avoid disputes.

**Important:**
- Payment providers impose monitoring programs, penalties, and higher chargeback costs for sellers with high chargeback rates (~0.7%+).
- We monitor and manage chargeback rates to prevent exceeding problematic thresholds.
- If chargebacks increase, we may need to intervene or suspend accounts unless proactive measures are taken.

Before initiating a chargeback, **please email us first**—we're happy to resolve disputes directly with your merchant.
