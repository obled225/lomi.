As a **Merchant of Record**, we are the reseller of all goods and services. Therefore, we need to make sure that entrepreneurs and businesses using lomi. comply with our acceptable products & use policies. We perform continuous monitoring, reviews, and preventive actions to prevent fraud.

## Activation process

Every lomi. merchant will need to go through a **KYC/KYB process** ahead of using our platform. We'll process this request within 12 hours (often faster).

During this time, we'll perform the following checks:

- A quick survey about your business, products, and intended use case with our technology.
- Identity verification (KYC) using passport (or driver's license), business registration documents, and company/entrepreneur tax ID.

We need to perform this review directly after sign-up to ensure compliance with our acceptable products & use policy and meet our own **KYC/AML requirements** as a payment platform operating in West Africa in accordance with our partnerships with payment providers, the regulations defined by the BCEAO and the laws of the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire.

### Submit upfront and never worry again

We'll ask our merchants to submit this information upfront to speed up the set-up of lomi. and enable them to enjoy all our products and services without concern about any issues or future delays.

## Continuous reviews (async)

We continuously monitor all operations and logs across our platform to proactively prevent fraud, in addition to performing asynchronous reviews of accounts at certain sales thresholds. These reviews are often completed within hours and without any additional information required from you.

You'll get notified over email if a review is taking place on your account. Payouts might be paused during this time, but this pause has no impact on your customers' experience or ability to purchase, subscribe, or checkout at any time.

We look at:
- Internal risk scores across historic transactions
- Refund and chargeback ratio
- The appropriate sales threshold for the next review, based on the above factors

### High chargeback ratios

Credit card networks consider 0.7% of sales in chargebacks excessive. Exceeding this threshold can lead to monitoring programs with high costs, penalties, and ultimately termination. (Note: Mobile money typically has almost 0% chargebacks, making it far less risky.)

Therefore, we reach out proactively to collaborate on maintaining a low chargeback ratio and reducing it before getting close to this ratio.

## Supported countries

### Payments

As your Merchant of Record, we take on the liability for local and international sales taxes and regulatory compliance so you'll never have to worry about this.

We enable businesses to accept local payments across West Africa but also international card payments from around the world without hidden fees therefore you can accept payments from all around the world with lomi. However some restrictions might happen, especially on certain mobile providers — in those situations we work on ensuring that your customers are informed thanks to error handling during transaction and yourself via email.

### Payouts

lomi. is built on multiple West African payment providers and currently supports low-cost mobile money and free bank payouts to businesses established in the UEMOA (West African Economic and Monetary Union). These are the countries that we consider "local":

- Sénégal
- Côte d'Ivoire
- Mali
- Burkina Faso
- Guinea-Bissau
- Niger
- Ghana
- Rwanda
- More countries are being added regularly.

For countries not listed above, we also offer international bank payouts, but this option comes with a fee. See our pricing section for more information about this in the following section.
