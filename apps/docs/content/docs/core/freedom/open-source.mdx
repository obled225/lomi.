title: "Open-source"
description: "We are committed to enabling fast, adapted, and accessible payments for everyone. As part of this commitment, our technology is entirely public and available online."

We offer both an open-source solution and a hosted platform to cater to the diverse needs of our merchants. In line with our vision of transparency and community collaboration, we follow a **dual-license approach**.

Our project is primarily licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)**, allowing the open-source community to freely use, modify, and redistribute our software. However, the AGPL requires that anyone using the software — especially when providing it as a service — **must also make the source code available to the public**. Therefore, if you wish to use **lomi.** without sharing your modifications, i.e incorporating it into closed-source products, or use it commercially to offer similar products or services, **a commercial license is required**.

Certain components of our system are covered exclusively by our second license, referred to as the **commercial license**, designed to meet the needs of businesses requiring additional features or usage flexibility. This **dual-licensing model** ensures we serve both the open-source community and enterprise partners.

This section provides an overview of the deployment options available and how to get started.

## Self-hosting

If you would like to host the platform yourself and never pay our technology fees, you can easily get started by cloning our main repository on GitHub. You'll get access to the latest version of our solution and be able to customize it to your needs. However, you'll have to get commercial agreements and API keys directly from payment providers to fully leverage our products in self-service.

For details on the codebase layout, see the [codebase](/docs/core/freedom/codebase) page.

Merchants looking for an easy way to accept payments do not need to worry about this — anyone can simply start using lomi. on our website without any restrictions and/or additional setup. While self-hosting is possible, it is not something we recommend for most merchants, as you'll lose the benefits of having a dedicated Merchant of Record and the speed and ease of use lomi. can provide to your business.
