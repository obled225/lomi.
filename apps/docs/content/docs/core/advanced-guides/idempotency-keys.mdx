title: "Idempotency keys"
description: "Idempotency ensures that an API request, if retried due to a network error or timeout, won't accidentally be performed multiple times. This is crucial for operations like creating payments or refunds to prevent duplicate actions.
"

## How it works

When you make a potentially mutating API request (like `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`), you can include a unique `Idempotency-Key` in the request header.

1.  **Generate a Unique Key:** Create a unique string (e.g., a UUID) for each distinct operation you want to perform. This key represents the *intent* to perform the operation.
2.  **Include the Header:** Send the key in the `Idempotency-Key` header with your request.
3.  **First Request:** lomi. processes the request normally and stores the result associated with your key.
4.  **Subsequent Requests (Same Key):** If lomi. receives another request with the **same key** within 24 hours, it will not re-process the operation. Instead, it will return the **same response** (success or error) that it sent for the original request.

## Using idempotency keys

Include the `Idempotency-Key` header in your API calls. Most lomi. SDKs provide a way to pass this easily.

```typescript filename="Using idempotency key with Node.js SDK"
import { LomiSDK } from '@lomi/sdk';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

const lomi = new LomiSDK({ apiKey: process.env.LOMI_API_KEY! });

// Generate a unique key *before* making the request
const idempotencyKey = uuidv4(); // e.g., 'f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479'

try {
  const session = await lomi.checkoutSessions.create({
    merchant_id: 'your_merchant_id',
    amount: 1000,
    currency_code: 'XOF',
    allowed_providers: ['WAVE'],
    success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
    cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',
    // ... other params
  }, {
    // Pass the key in the request options
    idempotencyKey: idempotencyKey
  });
  console.log('Checkout session created/retrieved:', session.data.checkout_session_id);
  // Store the key and the result (session ID) associated with your operation
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to create checkout session:', error);
  // Handle the error
}
```

```typescript filename="Using idempotency key with direct API calls (fetch)"
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

const idempotencyKey = uuidv4();
const apiKey = process.env.LOMI_API_KEY;
const apiUrl = 'https://api.lomi.africa/v1/checkout-sessions'; // Use correct endpoint

async function createSessionDirectly() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
        'Idempotency-Key': idempotencyKey,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        merchant_id: 'your_merchant_id',
        amount: 1000,
        currency_code: 'XOF',
        allowed_providers: ['WAVE'],
        success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
        cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',
        // ... other params
      })
    });

    const data = await response.json();

    if (!response.ok) {
      // Handle API error (response.status, data.error)
      console.error(`API Error (${response.status}):`, data.error);
      return;
    }

    console.log('Checkout session created/retrieved:', data.data.checkout_session_id);

  } catch (networkError) {
    console.error('Network error during request:', networkError);
    // Implement retry logic here if appropriate, reusing the SAME idempotencyKey
  }
}

createSessionDirectly();
```

## Generating keys

Keys must be unique for each distinct operation.

-   **UUIDs:** Recommended approach. Generate a standard UUID v4 for each request attempt.
    ```typescript
    import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
    const key = uuidv4();
    ```
-   **Deterministic Keys:** You can create keys based on unique aspects of the operation (e.g., user ID + order ID + timestamp), but ensure the resulting key is truly unique for each *intended* operation. Be cautious about collisions.

## Key lifecycle

-   lomi. stores idempotency keys and their corresponding responses for **24 hours**.
-   After 24 hours, a key expires and can potentially be reused, although using unique keys like UUIDs is generally safer.
-   Sending a request with a key that was used within the last 24 hours for a *different* request body might result in an error.

## Error handling

If you retry a request with an idempotency key that was already successfully processed, you'll receive the original successful response (HTTP `200 OK`).

If the original request failed (e.g., HTTP `400 Bad Request`), retrying with the same key will return the original error response. You won't be able to fix the request by simply retrying with the same key.

Specific idempotency-related errors (though less common if using UUIDs correctly):

-   **`409 Conflict` (or similar):** Might occur if you attempt to reuse a key with different request parameters than the original request within the 24-hour window.

## Best practices

1.  **Use for Mutating Requests:** Primarily use idempotency keys for `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests where duplicate operations could cause issues.
2.  **Generate Keys Correctly:** Use a robust method like UUID v4 to ensure uniqueness for each operation attempt.
3.  **Retry Network Errors:** When a request fails due to a network error or timeout (where you don't receive a definitive success or failure from lomi.), retry the request using the **exact same idempotency key**.
4.  **Don't Retry Client Errors:** Do not retry requests that failed with a `4xx` status code (other than potentially `429 Rate Limit Exceeded`) using the same idempotency key. Fix the underlying issue in the request first and generate a *new* key for the corrected request.
5.  **Store Keys (Optional):** You might store the idempotency key alongside your internal record of the operation (e.g., in your order database) to aid in tracking and debugging retries.

## Common scenarios

-   **Creating Payments/Checkout Sessions:** Essential to prevent charging a customer twice if your initial request times out but was actually processed by lomi..
-   **Creating Refunds:** Prevents accidentally refunding a transaction multiple times.
-   **Creating Customers/Products/Webhooks:** Useful to avoid creating duplicate resources due to retries.
