The `lomi. login` command authenticates the **lomi. CLI**, allowing it to securely interact with the **lomi. API** on your behalf using a dedicated **CLI Token**. This authentication is a prerequisite for most commands that require API access (like `status`, `payments`, `webhook`, and `dev`).

## Usage

```bash filename="Terminal"
lomi. login
```

## How it works

This command uses a secure **Device Authorization Grant** flow (a standard OAuth 2.0 flow designed for input-constrained devices like CLIs):

1.  **Initiation**: The CLI contacts the **lomi.** authentication service to start the login process.
2.  **Device Code Request**: The service generates a unique `user_code` (which you'll enter in the browser) and a `device_code` (used internally by the CLI to check for completion).
3.  **User Interaction**:
    *   The CLI displays the `user_code` for you to copy.
    *   It prompts you to press Enter, after which it attempts to open your default web browser to the **lomi.** `verification_uri`.
    *   In the browser, you log in to your **lomi.** account (if not already logged in) and enter the `user_code` when prompted to authorize the CLI.
4.  **Polling**: While you are authenticating in the browser, the CLI periodically polls the authentication service using the `device_code` to check if the authorization has been granted.
5.  **Token Retrieval**: Once you successfully approve the authorization in the browser, the authentication service provides a secure, short-lived **CLI Token** to the waiting CLI.
6.  **Secure Storage**: The CLI saves this **CLI Token** securely in the global configuration file (typically `~/.lomi/config.json`). This token is used for subsequent API calls made *by the CLI itself*.

  This device flow avoids the need for you to manually handle or store your main `LOMI_API_KEY` for general CLI operations, enhancing the security of your primary credentials.

## Output example

Upon successful login, you will see a confirmation message:

```text filename="Terminal output example"
Login initiated.

Action Required to complete authentication:

1. Copy this code: XXXX-XXXX

2. Press enter to open your browser

3. Paste the code when prompted on the webpage.

IMPORTANT: After signing in, you might be redirected elsewhere...
Please manually navigate back to the verification URL: https://lomi.africa/verify

Login successful! CLI Token saved globally.

You can now run lomi. CLI commands that require authentication.
Use `lomi. init` in your project directory to set up SDK-specific API keys.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Browser not opening**: If the browser doesn't open automatically, manually copy the `verification_uri` shown in the terminal and paste it into your browser's address bar.
-   **Code expired**: The `user_code` is time-sensitive. If it expires before you complete the authorization, simply run `lomi. login` again to get a new code.
-   **Access denied**: If you deny the authorization request in the browser, the CLI login will fail. Run `lomi. login` again if this was unintentional.
-   **Network errors**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection, as the CLI needs to communicate with the **lomi.** authentication service.
-   **Firewall issues**: If you are behind a strict firewall, ensure it allows HTTPS connections to `lomi.africa`. Check your firewall settings or contact your network administrator if you suspect issues.
