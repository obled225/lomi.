The `lomi. init` command bootstraps an integration within your existing project directory. It focuses on setting up essential configuration and example code from the lomi. Node.js SDK, enabling your application to communicate with the API.

## Usage

Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal and run:

```bash filename="Terminal"
lomi. init
```

## What it does

This command performs the following actions:

<Steps>

### Prompts for configuration

Interactively asks for necessary details to configure the **SDK** usage within your project:
-   **API Key (`LOMI_API_KEY`)**: Your **secret API key** obtained from the **lomi. Merchant Portal**. This is stored in the `.env` file specifically for your SDK to authenticate its requests. **This is different from the CLI Token used by `lomi. login`.**
-   **Environment**: Choose between `production` (live) and `sandbox` (testing) **lomi. API** endpoints for the SDK.
-   **Webhook Secret (`LOMI_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)**: Your webhook signing secret from the **lomi. Merchant Portal**. Stored in `.env` for your *application* to verify incoming webhook signatures.
-   **Language**: Choose between `TypeScript` and `JavaScript` for the generated example SDK usage code.
-   **Package Manager**: Select your preferred package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`) for installing SDK dependencies.

### Creates `.env` file

Generates a `.env` file in your project root containing the credentials needed by the **lomi. Node.js SDK** in your application:

```dotenv filename=".env"
# Your lomi. API Key (get it from https://lomi.africa/portal/settings/api-keys)
LOMI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Your Webhook Signing Secret (get it from https://lomi.africa/portal/webhooks)
LOMI_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

# API URL for the SDK (defaults to production)
# Use https://sandbox.api.lomi.africa/v1 for testing
LOMI_API_URL=https://api.lomi.africa/v1
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️" title="Security: Ignore .env">
  Always add your `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your secret credentials to version control.
</Callout>

### Creates example files

Generates example code illustrating how to use the **lomi. Node.js SDK** based on your language choice:
-   **`lib/lomi./client.{ts|js}`**: Sets up and exports initialized **lomi. SDK** clients, loading credentials from the `.env` file.
-   **`examples/checkout.{ts|js}`**: Demonstrates creating a checkout session using the configured SDK client.
-   **`examples/webhook.{ts|js}`**: Provides a basic HTTP server example for receiving and verifying webhook events using the SDK and the `LOMI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from `.env`.

### Installs dependencies

Installs necessary packages (`lomi.`, `dotenv`) for using the SDK and loading environment variables, using your selected package manager.

</Steps>

## Output example

After completion, the command displays a summary:

```text filename="Terminal output example"
Project setup complete!

Created Files:
- .env (Contains SDK API Key & Webhook Secret - KEEP SAFE & add to .gitignore!)
- lib/lomi./client.ts
- examples/checkout.ts
- examples/webhook.ts

Installed Dependencies:
- lomi.
- dotenv

Next Steps:
1. Review the example code in `lib/` and `examples/`.
2. Load environment variables (from `.env`) in your application before initializing the lomi. SDK client.
3. Start building your lomi. integration!
4. Use `lomi. dev` to test webhook events locally during development.
5. Verify your CLI login status with `lomi. status` if needed.
```

## Prerequisites

-   You should ideally run `lomi. login` first to authenticate the CLI itself, although `init` primarily focuses on SDK setup.
-   Have your **lomi. API key** and **webhook secret** ready from the **lomi. Merchant Portal** (Settings > API Keys & Webhooks sections).
