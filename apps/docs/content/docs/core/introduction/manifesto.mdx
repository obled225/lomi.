description: 'The time has come to open-source payment processing (and software in general) across Africa.'

We believe that accepting payments shouldn't be complex, regardless of where you operate or what payment methods your customers prefer. The fragmented payment landscape of our region creates unnecessary barriers and friction for businesses trying to grow beyond national borders. We aim to address these challenges with a new approach to payment processing.

We believe that:

- Every venture, regardless of its size, should easily be able to sell online with a few lines of code and zero technical and administrative burden.
- Builders should focus on growing their business, not wrestling with payment.
- Innovation in financial services must be accessible to all.
- Payment solutions must be built by and for local ecosystems.

## Our principles

To achieve this vision, we've built lomi. on these three foundational principles:

### Merchant first

- Your success is our success.
- Every feature we build solves one of your needs.
- Pricing is transparent and fair.
- Your feedback drives our roadmap.

### Local context matters

- We build specifically for West African markets, starting with Côte d'Ivoire.
- We strive to listen and understand local payment behaviors to adapt to local realities.
- We respect the partners who trust us and operate with a high level of execution and integrity.

### Community matters

- Open source is more than just code sharing; it is a mindset, and it is in our blood.
- Community contributions at every stage of our development process are welcome, valued, and recognized.
- Knowledge sharing is essential to our success.

By making our platform open-source, we aim to:

- Foster transparency and trust with our builders and partners.
- Encourage your contributions to continuously enhance the platform for everyone.
- Enable developers to extend and customize lomi. to suit their unique needs.
- Enable anyone to self-host lomi. for their unique use case.

Join us in our mission to simplify payment processing and to be the foundational open-source platform powering seamless payments for ventures across francophone West Africa by 2030.
