Our platform empowers ventures and entrepreneurs to focus on growth without worrying about the challenges of payment processing and billing. We aim to solve two core challenges:

## Payment complexity

The West African payment landscape is very fragmented, with numerous payment providers. This complexity often forces merchants to manage integrations themselves or rely on closed-source payment providers, leading to increased development time, high transaction costs, maintenance overhead, and technical debt.

lomi. solves this by providing:

- **One API, one dashboard**: One integration for all your payment needs, allowing you to accept credit card payments, MTN 'Momo', Wave Mobile Money, Orange Money, SPI, and more (we are continuously expanding our set of integrations to help you reach an ever-growing set of consumers in Africa and beyond).
- **Customizable checkout**: Highly customizable, seamless checkout experiences to boost conversion.
- **Enterprise-grade analytics**: Gain valuable insights into your customer demographics and behaviors through detailed transaction and customer reporting.
- **Maximum control**: Streamlined transaction reconciliation, refunds, and fast payouts to bank accounts and mobile money wallets.
- **Powerful dashboard**: Comprehensive back-office for business management to help you sell goods, services, subscriptions, and more.

## Lack of transparency

The financial technology landscape in West Africa has historically suffered from opacity in operations, high and hidden fees, and limited visibility into transaction processing. Merchants often struggle with black-box payment processors that are slow to integrate, have high fees, and provide little insight into how their money moves.

lomi. addresses this through:

- **Robust logic and security**: Full transparency into transaction flows, fee structures, and transaction/payout processing.
- **Open-source architecture**: Our codebase is public, allowing anyone to review, audit, and contribute to our software — [see our codebase structure](/docs/freedom/codebase).
- **Community governance**: Transparent roadmap and decision-making process with merchant input via pull requests and feature requests as GitHub issues.
- **Built-in compliance**:
  - Licensed payment service provider from the BCEAO (Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest)
  - Regular security updates and compliance monitoring
  - PCI DSS level 4 compliant
  - GDPR AND MACP compliant with 100% of our data flows transiting through Cape Town in South Africa and Dublin in Ireland.

Our platform is designed with security-first principles, ensuring that both merchants and their customers can transact with confidence.
