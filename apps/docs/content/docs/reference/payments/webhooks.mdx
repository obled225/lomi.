description: "Configure webhook endpoints for real-time event notifications."
---

Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications about events that occur in your lomi. account, such as successful payments, subscription renewals, or failed transactions. Instead of polling the API, you can configure a webhook endpoint where lomi will send event data via HTTP `` `POST` `` requests.

## Base URL

```http filename="Terminal"
https://api.lomi.africa/v1
```

## Authentication

API requests to manage webhooks require authentication using an API key in the `` `X-API-Key` `` header. See [Authentication](/docs/reference/setup/authentication).

```http filename="Terminal"
X-API-Key: your_api_key
```

## Webhook security

To ensure the security and integrity of webhook events, lomi. signs each request sent to your endpoint using a unique secret associated with that webhook.

1.  **Signature Header:** Each webhook request includes an `` `X-Lomi-Signature` `` HTTP header.
2.  **Webhook Secret:** When you create a webhook endpoint via the API, a `` `secret` `` (prefixed with `` `whsec_` ``) is returned. **Store this secret securely, as it will not be shown again.**
3.  **Verification:** Your endpoint should verify the signature by computing an `` `HMAC-SHA256` `` hash of the raw request body using the webhook secret and comparing it to the signature provided in the header.

Refer to the [Webhook Signature Verification](/docs/core/advanced-guides/handling-webhooks) guide for detailed implementation examples in various languages.

## Webhook events

When creating or updating a webhook, you subscribe it to specific event types. lomi. will only send notifications for the events you've subscribed to.

| Event Enum                    | Description                                  | Data Payload Type |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `` `PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED` ``           | A one-time payment is successful.            | `` `Transaction` ``       |
| `` `PAYMENT_FAILED` ``              | A one-time payment attempt failed.           | `` `Transaction` ``       |
| `` `CHECKOUT_COMPLETED` ``          | A checkout session was completed.            | `` `CheckoutSession` ``   |
| `` `SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED` ``        | A new subscription is created.               | `` `Subscription` ``      |
| `` `SUBSCRIPTION_RENEWED` ``        | A subscription successfully renews.          | `` `Subscription` ``      |
| `` `SUBSCRIPTION_PAYMENT_FAILED` `` | A scheduled subscription payment failed.     | `` `Subscription` ``      |
| `` `SUBSCRIPTION_CANCELED` ``       | A subscription is canceled.                  | `` `Subscription` ``      |
| `` `REFUND_COMPLETED` ``            | A refund is successfully processed.          | `` `Refund` ``            |
| `` `PROVIDER_STATUS_CHANGED` ``     | The status of a connected provider changes.  | `` `ProviderSetting` ``   |
| `` `test.webhook` ``                | A test event generated via the API.          | `` `TestPayload` ``       |

*(Note: The specific structure of the data payload for each event type will be documented under the respective API resource, e.g., Transactions, Subscriptions.)*

**Example response (204 No Content):** No response body.

## Testing webhooks

You can test your webhook endpoints using the API or `` `curl` ``.

### Create a webhook for testing

First, create a webhook endpoint pointing to a test receiver (e.g., using a service like [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) or a local tunnel like ngrok).

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Replace API_KEY and URL
curl -X POST "https://api.lomi.africa/v1/webhooks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "url": "YOUR_TEST_WEBHOOK_URL",
    "authorized_events": ["PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED", "test.webhook"],
    "description": "Test Endpoint"
  }'
```

Note the `` `id` `` and `` `secret` `` from the response.

### Send a test event

Use the `` `POST /webhooks/{id}/test` `` endpoint to send a predefined `` `test.webhook` `` event to your endpoint.

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Replace WEBHOOK_ID and API_KEY
curl -X POST "https://api.lomi.africa/v1/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/test" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Check your test receiver to confirm the event was received and verify the signature using the stored secret.

## Delivery logs and retries

lomi. logs webhook delivery attempts and provides endpoints to view these logs and manually retry failed deliveries.

### Get webhook delivery logs

Retrieves delivery logs for a specific webhook, showing success/failure status, timestamps, response codes, etc.

**Endpoint:** `` `GET /webhooks/{id}/logs` ``

**Path parameters:**

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                   |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `` `id` ``      | `` `string` `` | Yes      | ID of the webhook (`` `wh_...` ``) |

**Query parameters (optional):**

| Parameter | Type    | Description                        |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `` `limit` ``   | `` `integer` `` | Number of logs to return (max 100) |
| `` `offset` ``  | `` `integer` `` | Number of logs to skip (pagination)|
| `` `success` `` | `` `boolean` `` | Filter by successful deliveries    |
| `` `failed` ``  | `` `boolean` `` | Filter by failed deliveries        |

**Example request:**

```bash
# Replace WEBHOOK_ID and API_KEY
curl -X GET "https://api.lomi.africa/v1/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/logs?limit=10&failed=true" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Retry webhook delivery

Manually triggers a retry for a specific failed delivery log entry.

**Endpoint:** `` `POST /webhooks/{webhook_id}/logs/{log_id}/retry` ``

**Path parameters:**

| Parameter    | Type   | Required | Description                         |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `` `webhook_id` `` | `` `string` `` | Yes      | ID of the webhook (`` `wh_...` ``)       |
| `` `log_id` ``     | `` `string` `` | Yes      | ID of the failed delivery log entry |

**Example request:**

```bash
# Replace WEBHOOK_ID, LOG_ID and API_KEY
curl -X POST "https://api.lomi.africa/v1/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/logs/YOUR_LOG_ID/retry" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Automatic retries:** lomi. automatically retries failed deliveries using an exponential backoff strategy over approximately 6 hours before marking the delivery as permanently failed.

## Best practices

-   **Verify signatures:** Always verify the `` `X-Lomi-Signature` `` to ensure the request is from lomi.
-   **Respond quickly:** Your endpoint should return a `` `2xx` `` status code within a few seconds. Offload longer processing to background jobs.
-   **Handle retries:** Be prepared for lomi. to retry sending events if your endpoint fails or times out.
-   **Idempotency:** Design your event processing logic to handle duplicate events gracefully.
-   **Secure your secret:** Store your webhook secret securely using environment variables or a secrets manager.
