title: "Refunds"
description: "The Refunds API allows you to retrieve details about refunds processed for transactions associated with your merchant account."
---

**Note: This API is currently in Beta**

*Currently, creating refunds via the API is not supported; refunds are typically initiated through the merchant dashboard or other internal mechanisms.*

## Authentication

Requests require authentication using your API key in the `` `X-API-Key` `` header. See the [Authentication](/docs/reference/setup/authentication) guide.

## The refund object

Represents a refund issued for a specific transaction. See [Data Models](/docs/reference/reference/data-models#refund-object) for the full structure (Note: This link assumes the object will be added to data-models.mdx).

## Endpoints

## Error handling

Common errors include `` `400 Bad Request` `` for an invalid refund ID format, `` `401 Unauthorized` ``, `` `404 Not Found` `` if the refund ID doesn't exist or belong to the merchant, and `` `500 Internal Server Error` ``. Refer to the [Errors](/docs/reference/reference/errors) guide for general structure and handling.
