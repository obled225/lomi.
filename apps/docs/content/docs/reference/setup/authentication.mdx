description: "All lomi. requests are authentified using API keys. Any request that doesn't include a valid API key will return an authentication error."

There are two types of API keys corresponding to lomi.'s two environments: Test and Live.

## API keys

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Requests made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

You must include an API key in the `` `X-API-Key` `` header for every request.

```http filename="API request header"
GET /v1/providers HTTP/1.1
Host: api.lomi.africa
X-API-Key: your_api_key
```

Replace `your_api_key` with your specific secret API key.

## Test vs. Live environments

lomi. provides two distinct environments to separate development and testing from production operations.

### Test environment

Use the test environment to develop and test your integration without processing real transactions or affecting live data. It mirrors the functionality of the live environment.

-   **API Keys:** Test API keys start with `` `lomi_sk_test_` ``.
-   **Base URL:** `` `https://sandbox.api.lomi.africa/v1` ``
-   **Rate Limits:** 120 requests per minute / 20,000 requests per day.
-   **Data:** Uses simulated data. Responses may include environment flags like `` `"environment": "test"` ``.

### Live environment

Use the live environment for production operations involving real transactions.

-   **API Keys:** Live API keys start with `` `lomi_sk_live_` ``.
-   **Base URL:** `` `https://api.lomi.africa/v1` ``
-   **Rate Limits:** 60 requests per minute / 10,000 requests per day.
-   **Data:** Processes real data. Responses may include environment flags like `` `"environment": "live"` ``.

To switch between environments, simply use the appropriate API key and base URL.

## Obtaining API keys

You can obtain your API keys after signing up and completing verification:

1.  Log in to the [dashboard](https://lomi.africa/portal).
2.  Navigate to the **Developers** or **API Settings** section.
3.  Generate separate API keys for the **Test** and **Live** environments.

## Key management and security

Treat your API keys as sensitive credentials. You can manage them (generate, revoke, view usage) in the merchant dashboard.

Best practices:

-   **Keep keys confidential:** Do not share your secret keys. Store them securely (e.g., environment variables, secrets management service).
-   **Never expose keys client-side:** Do not embed API keys in frontend code.
-   **Avoid version control:** Do not commit keys to your codebase.
-   **Use test keys for development:** Only use live keys for production applications.
-   **Rotate keys:** Consider rotating keys periodically or if you suspect a compromise.
-   **Limit access:** Restrict access to API keys within your organization.
