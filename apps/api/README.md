## Quick Start

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

When deploying to Vercel, the application is automatically configured to run in a serverless environment. Key considerations:

- File system operations are limited in serverless environments
- Winston logger is configured to use only Console transports in production
- File logging is disabled in production to prevent ENOENT errors
- Set `NODE_ENV=production` in your Vercel environment variables

### Local Development

For local development:

- File logging is enabled
- Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory
- Make sure the `logs` directory exists in your development environment
